# CoMix: Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-Task Comic Understanding

This is the official repository for the CoMix multi-task benchmark.
The two resources we link here are:
- CVAT page where a user can see the (VAL) annotations
- Competition webpage where we host the held-out TEST set and the leaderboard

Regarding CVAT, in the submitted paper there are the specifics regarding hostname:port, and username:password to use to enter CVAT. This is to allow reviewers to check the data availability and quality, but not the public, yet.

Instead, for the competition, the page is hosted together with the Robust Reading Competition, [Comics Understanding](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=31).
